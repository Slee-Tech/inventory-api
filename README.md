### Flask REST API
A REST API for an inventory management system, to track inventory and transactions. Implemented using Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and Marshmallow for serialization.

Get started with:
```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    export FLASK_APP=application.py
    flask run
```
I've also included a shell script to start it: 
```
    ./setup.sh
```
Use Postman or another client to test the endpoints.
